**Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard**

**Project Overview**

This project provides an in-depth analysis of electric vehicle (EV) data across the United States using Tableau. The dashboard visualizes key insights about EV adoption trends, vehicle types, and geographical distribution, enabling users to explore the electric vehicle landscape in an interactive and meaningful way. This analysis is crucial in understanding the growing shift toward sustainable transportation and the role of clean alternative fuel vehicles.


**Dynamic Filtering with Slicers:** The dashboard allows users to filter and analyze EV data based on vehicle type, model, and state-wise distribution, enabling granular exploration of the dataset.

**Electric Vehicle Types:** Visualizes the comparison between different EV types such as Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), with detailed breakdowns of their eligibility for clean alternative fuel vehicle incentives.

**Model Year and Range:** Highlights trends in EV adoption based on model year and electric range, showcasing which vehicles and manufacturers are leading the transition to electric mobility.
**Geographical Distribution:** Provides a state-wise breakdown of electric vehicle registrations, helping identify which regions are seeing the most significant adoption of clean alternative fuel vehicles.

Tableau: For building the interactive, dynamic dashboard and providing powerful data visualization tools.

Data Sources: Includes a dataset of electric vehicles in the U.S., detailing information such as VIN, manufacturer, model year, city, state, electric vehicle type, clean fuel eligibility, electric range, and more.
Insights Uncovered

EV Type Distribution: Analyzes the market share of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) versus Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), showing the dominance of BEVs in certain regions.

Clean Alternative Fuel Eligibility: Assesses which vehicles qualify for clean fuel incentives, highlighting the increasing importance of government policies in promoting EV adoption.

Geographical Adoption: Visualizes which states and counties are leading the charge in EV registrations, with additional insights into local utility companies and census tracts related to the vehicles.

Electric Range: Explores how the electric range of vehicles has evolved over time, with models like Tesla and Hyundai standing out for their longer ranges.

**Interactive Dashboard**

The dashboard includes the following features:

EV Type Slicer: Filter and compare different electric vehicle types, including BEVs and PHEVs.

Model and Manufacturer Filters: Drill down into specific models and makes, such as Tesla, BMW, Hyundai, Jeep, and more.

State-Level Analysis: Visualize EV adoption and clean fuel eligibility by state and county, allowing for geographic comparison.

Year-Wise Trends: Analyze the distribution of EV models over the years to understand trends in new EV registrations and technological advancements.
